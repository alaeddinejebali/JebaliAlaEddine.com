					<li>JavaScript language first became available in the web browser
						Netscape Navigator 2. Initially, it was called LiveScript.
						However, because Java was the hot technology of the time, Netscape
						decided that JavaScript sounded more exciting. When JavaScript
						really took off, Microsoft decided to add its own brand of
						JavaScript, called JScript, to Internet Explorer.</li>
					<li>ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) is a private
						organization that develops standards in information and
						communication systems. One of the standards they control is for
						JavaScript, which they call ECMAScript.</li>
					<li>A website domain name (a friendly name) is converted to the
						actual IP address by computers called DNS (Domain Name Servers),
						which your Internet service provider will have set up for you.</li>
					<li>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to enhance
						static web applications by providing dynamic, personalized, and
						interactive content.</li>
					<li>JavaScript is an interpreted language rather than a compiled
						language: As the browser goes through the JavaScript, it passes it
						to a special program called an interpreter, which converts the
						JavaScript to the machine code your computer understands.</li>
					<li>The alternative compiled language is one in which the program
						code is converted to machine code before it's actually run, and
						this conversion has to be done only once.</li>
					<li>Including the "<strong>type</strong>" attribute is good
						practice, but within a web page it can be left off. Browsers such
						as IE and Firefox use JavaScript as their default script language.
						This means that if the browser encounters a &lte;script&gt; tag
						with no type attribute set, it assumes that the script block is
						written in JavaScript. However, use of the <strong>type</strong>
						attribute is specifi ed as mandatory by W3C
					</li>
					<li><?php include "code/javascript_code_01.txt"; ?></li>
					<li class="caution">Be ware of linking to external fi les if they
						are controlled by other people. It would give those people the
						ability to control and change your web page, so you need to be
						very sure you trust them!</li>
					<li>When the browser loads in the web page, the browser goes
						through it, rendering it tag by tag from top to bottom of the
						page. This process is called <strong>parsing</strong>.
					</li>
					<li>The message box displayed by the alert() function is "<strong>modal</strong>":
						It simply means that the message box won't go away until the user
						closes it by clicking the OK button. In fact, parsing of the page
						stops at the line where the alert() function is used and doesn't
						restart until the user closes the message box.
