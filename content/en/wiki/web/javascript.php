					<p>JavaScript language first became available in the web browser Netscape Navigator 2. Initially, it was called LiveScript. However, because Java was the hot technology of the time, Netscape decided that JavaScript sounded more exciting. When JavaScript really took off, Microsoft decided to add its own brand of JavaScript, called JScript, to Internet Explorer.</p>
					<p>ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) is a private organization that develops standards in information and communication systems. One of the standards they control is for JavaScript, which they call ECMAScript.</p>
					<p>A website domain name (a friendly name) is converted to the actual IP address by computers called DNS (Domain Name Servers), which your Internet service provider will have set up for you.</p>
					<p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to enhance static web applications by providing dynamic, personalized, and interactive content.</p>
					<p>JavaScript is an interpreted language rather than a compiled language: As the browser goes through the JavaScript, it passes it to a special program called an interpreter, which converts the JavaScript to the machine code your computer understands.</p>
					<p>The alternative compiled language is one in which the program code is converted to machine code before it’s actually run, and this conversion has to be done only once.</p>
					<p>Including the "<strong>type</strong>" attribute is good practice, but within a web page it can be left off. Browsers such as IE and Firefox use JavaScript as their default script language. This means that if the browser encounters a &lte;script&gt; tag with no type attribute set, it assumes that the script block is written in JavaScript. However, use of the <strong>type</strong> attribute is specifi ed as mandatory by W3C</p>
					<p>
<pre><code class="javascript">
	<script type="text/javascript" src="myJavascriptFile.js"></script>
</code></pre>

					<p class="caution">Be ware of linking to external fi les if they are controlled by other people. It would give those people the ability to control and change your web page, so you need to be very sure you trust them!</p>
					<p>When the browser loads in the web page, the browser goes through it, rendering it tag by tag from top to bottom of the page. This process is called <strong>parsing</strong>.</p>
					<p>The message box displayed by the alert() function is "<strong>modal</strong>": It simply means that the message box won’t go away until the user closes it by clicking the OK button. In fact, parsing of the page stops at the line where the alert() function is used and doesn’t restart until the user closes the message box.</p>

					<p>JavaScript, on the other hand, is a weakly typed language and a lot more forgiving about how you use different types of data.</p>
					<p>JavaScript treats integer and floating-points numbers as floatingpoint numbers. It kindly hides the detail from you so you generally don’t need to worry about it. One exception is when you want an integer but you have a fl oating-point number, in which case you’ll round the number to make it an integer.</p>
